                    Wegovy is a prescription weight loss treatment that contains

                    medications called GLP-1 inhibitors.¹

                    It works by mimicking a naturally occurring hormone in the
                    body called GLP-1, stimulating nerve receptors in the brain
                    that control appetite, so you feel less hungry and have

                    Additionally, it stimulates the release of insulin from

                    pancreas and the brain.³ Implementing behavioural change
                    strategies alongside the treatment is known to be an
                    effective method for weight loss.
